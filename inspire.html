  <h2>What makes a hero in the tech world?</h2>
  <p>
    A hero in the tech world is someone who embodies the notion that
    communication over the Internet should never be censored and that people
    should be able to communicate as they so wish. A hero in the tech world
    also possesses an innate curosity and quick-witted nature in order to stay
    innovating with the swiftly evolving internet.

    Aaron Swartz was The Internet's Own Boy. Aaron Swartz was a brilliant
    computer programmer and internet activist that strongly believed in
    Internet Freedom. Swartz was a strong advocate for open access to
    information, particularly academic research. He believed that knowledge
    should be freely accessible to all, rather than locked behind paywalls.
    Swartz was also a firm believer in fostering innovation and creativity
    through open sharing and collaboration. He co-authored the "RSS 1.0"
    specification at a young age and was involved in creating web technologies
    that promoted the sharing of content online. Swartz was additionally one of the
    early architects of Creative Commons and a developer of the Internet
    Archives' Open Library, a free book database and digital library open to
    the public.
