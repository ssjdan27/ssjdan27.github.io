  <h1>Amusing Sites!</h1>
  <h3>By Daniel Garza</h3>
  <h2>Guthib</h2>
  <p>
    This is a silly website that a lot of people probably happen to stumble
    upon when mispelling GitHub!

  <h2>Emacs YouTube Video</h2>
  <p>
    This is a completely serious video and peek into the life of an Emacs
    Enthusiast in 2023. You get to see what the workflow is like of someone
    who has in depth knowledge of Emacs!

  <h2>Old School Runescape</h2>
  <p>
    I would consider this as an amusing site because it
    <em>does</em> entertain me! Old School Runescape is by far one of the best
    MMO's out there and provides a near endless amount of content!
